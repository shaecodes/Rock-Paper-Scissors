# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This Python program implements the game of rock-paper-scissors, allowing users to play against a computer opponent. The computer randomly selects one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors), and the user inputs their choice. The program then determines the winner based on the rules of the game, and displays the result.

# Usage
Run the Python script in a Python environment.
Follow the prompts to input your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
The program will display the computer's choice and the result (tie, player wins, or computer wins).
Choose to play again or exit the program.

# Features
Randomized computer choice for varied gameplay.
Input validation to ensure valid choices from the user.
Option to play multiple rounds or exit the program.
Simple and easy-to-understand code for learning and practice purposes.
Technologies Used
Python 3.2
